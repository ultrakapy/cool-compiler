My COOL compiler is ready for world domination, lol. This has been one of the most challenging projects I've ever worked on. I've learned a lot! Feels great to be at this point after 4 weeks and 160+ hrs.

Details are forthcoming.

PA2J -> Lexical Analyzer<br/>
PA3J -> Parser<br/>
PA4J -> Semantic Analyzer<br/>
PA5J -> Code Generator (generates MIPS assembly code)<br/>

Why Study Compilers?

Everything that computers do is the result of some program, and all of the millions of programs in the world are written in one of the many thousands of programming languages that have been developed over the last 60 years. Designing and implementing a programming language turns out to be difficult; some of the best minds in computer science have thought about the problems involved and contributed beautiful and deep results. Learning something about compilers will show you the interplay of theory and practice in computer science, especially how powerful general ideas combined with engineering insight can lead to practical solutions to very hard problems. Knowing how a compiler works will also make you a better programmer and increase your ability to learn new programming languages quickly.
