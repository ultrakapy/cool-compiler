My COOL compiler is ready for world domination, lol. This has been one of the most challenging projects I've ever worked on. I've learned a lot! Feels great to be at this point after 4 weeks and 160+ hrs.

Details are forthcoming.

PA2J -> Lexical Analyzer
PA3J -> Parser
PA4J -> Semantic Analyzer
PA5J -> Code Generator (generates MIPS assembly code)
